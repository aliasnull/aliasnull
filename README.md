I'm a developer with a passion for crafting high-performance web experiences. While I have a background in blockchain, my core focus is now on modern web design and pushing the limits of the Blogger platform.  
I enjoy building, experimenting, and sharing open-source projects related to:


- 🎨 **Custom Blogger Themes** – From scratch XML development to modernization.
- 📄 **Landing Pages** – High-converting, responsive, and lightweight designs.
- 🛠️ **Blogger Development** – Advanced customization, widgets, and scripts.
- ⚡ **Web Performance** – SEO optimization and speed enhancements.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Design and develop unique, responsive Blogger templates.
- Create stand-alone landing pages for products and portfolios.
- Port modern HTML/CSS templates into functional Blogger XML.
- Write scripts and hacks to extend the functionality of legacy platforms.

## 🧑‍💻 Current Focus
- Developing a suite of minimalist, SEO-ready Blogger themes.
- Experimenting with modern CSS frameworks within the Blogger ecosystem.
- Building dynamic landing pages that prioritize user experience.
- Documenting my development journey and sharing resources here on GitHub.

## 🌍 Beyond Code
Design is about more than just aesthetics; it's about accessibility and speed. I am dedicated to proving that platforms like Blogger can still compete with modern CMSs when handled correctly. My goal is to build beautiful, functional tools that help creators publish their best work.
