I'm a developer with a passion for crafting high-performance web experiences. While I have a background in blockchain, my core focus is now on **modern web design** and pushing the limits of the **Blogger** platform.

I enjoy building, experimenting, and sharing open-source projects related to:  

- 🎨 **Custom Blogger Themes** – From scratch XML development to modernization.  
- 📄 **Landing Pages** – High-converting, responsive, and lightweight designs.  
- 🛠️ **Blogger Development** – Advanced customization, widgets, and scripts.  
- ⚡ **Web Performance** – SEO optimization and speed enhancements.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Design and develop **unique, responsive Blogger templates**.  
- Create **stand-alone landing pages** for products and portfolios.  
- Port modern HTML/CSS templates into **functional Blogger XML**.  
- Write **scripts and hacks** to extend the functionality of legacy platforms.

## 🧑‍💻 Current Focus
- Developing a suite of **minimalist, SEO-ready Blogger themes**.  
- Experimenting with **modern CSS frameworks** within the Blogger ecosystem.  
- Building **dynamic landing pages** that prioritize user experience.  
- Documenting my development journey and sharing resources here on GitHub.

## 🌍 Beyond Code
Design is about more than just aesthetics; it's about accessibility and speed. I am dedicated to proving that platforms like Blogger can still compete with modern CMSs when handled correctly. My goal is to build **beautiful, functional tools** that help creators publish their best work.
